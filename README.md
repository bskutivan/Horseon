#  HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

In this challenge I was asked to refactor the HTML and CSS sheets of the Horseon page.

The HTML of the page was covered in div elements and had no semantic elements or comments. I first tackled this by reducing the amount of divs by adding a Header element, Footer element, Nav element, and multiple Section elements. I then adjusted the classes of the content and benefits sections to reduce redundancy and apply the same styling across multiple elements that were styled the same.
The value in the href attribute for the search engine optimization nav link was broken so I fixed that.

The CSS style sheet had a lot of duplicating styles so I used the classes I made for content and benefits to consolidate the same styles across multiple elements. I moved some of the simple stylings to the top of the sheet and kep the specific element stylings grouped together in order of appearance. I added comments to make it easier to move around the style sheet quickly.
